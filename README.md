# 💼 Payroll System

A Java-based **Payroll System** that uses **Abstraction and Inheritance** to calculate salaries for different types of employees.  
The system calculates and displays the salaries of **full-time** and **part-time employees**.

---

## 📋 Description
The **Payroll System** demonstrates:
- **Abstraction:** 
  - `Employee` is an abstract class with a common method `displayDetails()` and an abstract method `calculateSalary()` for subclasses to implement.
- **Inheritance:** 
  - Two subclasses `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` inherit from the base class.
- **Dynamic Method Binding:** 
  - The `calculateSalary()` method is dynamically bound based on the type of employee at runtime.

## ✨ Features

- 💰 **Dynamic Salary Calculation:** 
  - **Full-Time Employees:** Fixed monthly salary.
  - **Part-Time Employees:** Salary calculated based on hourly rate and hours worked.
- 📊 **Employee Details Display:** Shows the employee name, ID, and salary information.
